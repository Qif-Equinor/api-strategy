# Equinor API Strategy

APIs are key to achieving business agility, unlocking new value in existing assets, and accelerating the process of delivering new ideas to the market.

With the recently released [TR1621 v7](http://docmap.statoil.no/DocMap/page/doc/dmDocIndex.html?DOCVIEW=FALSE?DOCID=1039106), Equinor is heading towards an "API first strategy". 

To accelerate this process, CIT via Chief Engineer IT, needs to establish an API strategy, policies and guidelines for development of APIs within the company.
